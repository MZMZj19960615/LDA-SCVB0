IMPORTANT:
1. Make sure that minibatch size divides the total number of documents. For example in KOS dataset, the minibatch size could be 343.
To pass in variable minibatch size add it as an optional last argument.

2. For running time please refer to the report. We find that for NYTimes convergence as soon as 200 iterations, about 1.5 days of operation. 

3. Running the makefiles :

'make all' : Build with OpenMP flag [ Normal paralleized operation]
'make serial' : Build without OpenMP flag (not recommended)
'make clean' : Removes executable created by previous make
